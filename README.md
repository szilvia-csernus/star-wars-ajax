I created this small app by following [Matt Rudge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrudge73/)'s walktrough tutorial. The aim was to show how to fetch data from a public API with pagination.

The project uses STAR WARS data.

It uses two approaches: one builds the table modularly, the other one mainly uses innerHTML text.
Data fetching happens with XMLHttpRequest().

To run the dev web server:

`python3 -m http.server`
